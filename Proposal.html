        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>A previous attempt at utilizing an online health platform that is designed 
                to help users evaluate and understand their health symptoms is WebMD. 
                This website allows users to input the symptoms an individual is 
                experiencing, ask questions to narrow down the possibilities, 
                produce possible conditions, and read information on possible 
                causes and symptoms. It provides general content and suggestions 
                based on the user's symptoms without taking into account an 
                individual's medical history. However, there is potential for 
                improvements like more customizability features for the users, 
                incorporating the context of a user's history, and providing 
                more relevant information. Overall, WebMD has attempted to provide
                individuals with an online space to seek guidance in understanding 
                health indicators.</p>
