        <p>
            <!-- Tyler -->
            The general question we have is primarily based around the medical field with the central question being “is there an easier way to reduce the burden of seeking medical care?”.
             Based on the article made by USC it stated that ”38% of U.S. adults had skipped some form of health care (i.e., a test, treatment, visit, or prescription fill) in the past year due to financial burden”(USC EMHA Online,2023).
              One major information technology problem which may be spurring on this financial burden is the lack of easily accessible and accurate information online thus reducing the need for unnecessary hospital visits and undue financial hardship.
             Previously this was done during covid, but with the easing of covid policies so was telemedical services were also reduced as they were less financially viable.

        <p>A previous attempt at utilizing an online health platform that is designed 
            to help users evaluate and understand their health symptoms is WebMD. 
            This website allows users to input the symptoms an individual is 
            experiencing, ask questions to narrow down the possibilities, 
            produce possible conditions, and read information on possible 
            causes and symptoms. It provides general content and suggestions 
            based on the user's symptoms without taking into account an 
            individual's medical history. However, there is potential for 
            improvements like more customizability features for the users, 
            incorporating the context of a user's history, and providing 
            more relevant information. Overall, WebMD has attempted to provide
            individuals with an online space to seek guidance in understanding 
            health indicators.</p>
