        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Tyler -->
            The general question we have is primarily based around the medical field with the 
            central question being “is there an easier way to reduce the burden of seeking 
            medical care?”.Based on the article made by USC it stated that ”38% of U.S. 
            adults had skipped some form of health care (i.e., a test, treatment, visit, 
            or prescription fill) in the past year due to financial burden”(USC EMHA Online,2023).
            One major information technology problem which may be spurring on this 
            financial burden is the lack of easily accessible and accurate information 
            online thus reducing the need for unnecessary hospital visits and undue financial hardship.
            Previously this was done during covid, but with the easing of covid policies 
            so was telemedical services were also reduced as they were less financially viable.

            A previous attempt at utilizing an online health platform that is designed 
            to help users evaluate and understand their health symptoms is 
            <a href="symptoms.webmd.com/">WebMD</a> . 
            This website allows users to input the symptoms an individual is 
            experiencing, ask questions to narrow down the possibilities, 
            produce possible conditions, and read information on possible 
            causes and symptoms. It provides general content and suggestions 
            based on the user's symptoms without taking into account an 
            individual's medical history. However, there is potential for 
            improvements like more customizability features for the users, 
            incorporating the context of a user's history, and providing 
            more relevant information. Overall, WebMD has attempted to provide
            individuals with an online space to seek guidance in understanding 
            health indicators.

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Morgan -->
            The information that the users will be viewing is related to the user's given symptoms 
            such as valuable suggestions or insights into what they may be experiencing. 
            As well as users will be viewing content related to hospitals near their zip code. 
            This will be from an external data source where it contains the facility name, address, 
            city/town, and state of where the hospital is located near the given user. This data is 
            provided from <a href="https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/xubh-q36u">Centers for Medicare 
            & Medicaid Services</a>. As well as including possible resources about available government
            programs related to healthcare and assistance. There will be a wide range of information 
            that the user can digest and utilize for their well-being.
